# Project-Dice-Game.

I built this Dice Game App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It takes name inputs from both users and use the names to know who's turn during the game.
On each roll of the dice, it gives a score of numbers between 1 and 6, and adds it to the player's previous score.
It also displays the name of the winner and a confetti animation at the end of the game.
To make the game fair enough, when a player starts this round, the other one gets to start the next round.
First person to get to score 20 wins the game.
